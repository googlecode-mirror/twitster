## WHAT IS TWITSTER?

Put simply, Twitster is a PHP application that lets you display tweets from everyone you follow in Twitter.  What's more, you can tell Twitster to filter those tweets by a hash tag (#example).  That means you can basically create your own Twitter community, on your own site.


## INSTALLATION

1. Upload the Twitster files into the directory you want to use.  (e.g. http://mysite.com/twitster/)

2. Bring up that location in your browser.  Twitster will bring up a setup wizard the first time you access it.  

NOTE: You may need to make your make your Twitster directory writable (777) so the wizard can create your configuration file.  For security's sake, once you run the wizard, you should delete setup.php and set the main directory permissions back to something safer, like 755.

3. Fill in the setup form.  Leave the hash tag field empty if you want to display all your friend's tweets.  Click "Set Up Twitster".

4. Share!
