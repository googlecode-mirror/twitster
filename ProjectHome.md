# What Is Twitster? #

Put simply, **Twitster is a PHP application that lets you display tweets from everyone you follow in Twitter on your own web site**.  What's more, you can filter those tweets by a hash tag (#example) and create your own Twitter group.  You control who contributesâ€”the people that you follow.

## Installation: ##

**1. Unpack the Twitster download into the folder you want to use.  (e.g. http://mysite.com/twitster/)**

**2. Bring up that location in your browser.  Twitster will run a setup wizard the first time you access it.**

_NOTE: You may need to make your make your Twitster directory writable (777) so the wizard can create your configuration file.  For security's sake, once you run the wizard, you should delete setup.php and set the main directory permissions back to something safer, like 755._

**3. Fill in the setup form.  Leave the hash tag field empty if you want to display all your friend's tweets.  Click "Set Up Twitster".**

**4. Share!**
